Solar-powered aircraft and NHS treatment carrying drones are among latest innovations backed by £273 million of government and industry funding. This is a package to help UK aerospace sector seize jobs and growth opportunities from the global green flight revolution and other emerging sectors like drone technology.

Solar powered aircraft, ultra-efficient wings and medical treatment carrying drones are just some of the technologies backed by £273 million to advance lowcarbon aerospace innovation, economic growth and jobs, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has announced. 81,000 jobs have been created so far through the Aerospace Technology Institute Programme, with £97 billion of value added to the UK economy to date. Today £155 million of joint governmentindustry funding has been announced to support new projects unlocking the latest in green aerospace innovation, such as hydrogen and battery technology, and ultra-efficient manufacturing processes and technologies, such as digital and additive manufacturing – generating further job opportunities and leads in emerging technologies and sectors.

A further £105.5 million of government-industry funding will be shared by projects focused on developing air transport systems and enabling new vehicle technologies through the Future Flight Challenge. The projects could create more than 8,800 jobs and include making motorways safer and improving journey times by using electric drones to survey hazards, also using electric drones to distribute medical treatments across Scotland. Up to £12 million is to be made available through the Regulators’ Pioneer Fund to back initiatives that could unlock industries of the future through regulation – from flying cars to vaccine-carrying drones.
